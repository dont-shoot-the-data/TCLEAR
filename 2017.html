  <h3>Methodology &amp; Coding Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Victim list:</strong> Cases #1–25 follow the order documented in the HRC report <em>A Time to Act</em> (November 2017). Cases #26–28 (Brooklyn BreYanna Stevenson, Brandi Seals, Jaylow McGlory) were identified after the report's publication. Total: 28 verified cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Solve rate:</strong> Of 25 non-police cases, 16 have identified suspects (64% clearance rate). Three suspects were acquitted: Tyrone Kemp (TeeTee Dangerfield case), Doris Carrasquillo (Kashmire Redd case, self-defense), and Desmond Harris (Jaylow McGlory case, self-defense). Two cases had charges dismissed: Kenne McFadden — Mark Daniel Lewis (double jeopardy) and Ava Le'Ray Barrin — Jalen Breon Brown (self-defense immunity, May 2018). One suspect was no-billed by grand jury (Gwynevere River Song — Robert Wayne Mosher, self-defense). An arrest warrant was issued for Leonard Ward in the Ciara McElveen case (July 2018), but it is unclear whether Ward was taken into custody.</li>
    <li><strong>Suspect race verification:</strong> All race codings verified from mugshot photos, explicit news descriptions, or court records — never inferred from surnames alone.</li>
    <li><strong>Bias motive coding:</strong> "Confirmed" = hate crime charges filed OR explicit anti-trans motive stated by police/prosecutors. "Suspected" = evidence of possible anti-trans animus but no formal hate-crime charge. "No Evidence" = documented IPV, robbery, family dispute, or other non-bias motive. "Unknown" = insufficient information or unsolved case with no known motive.</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon categories:</strong> "Firearm" includes all shootings including by police. "Stabbing" includes knife/sharp instrument. "Other" includes blunt force trauma, drowning, and burns.</li>
    <li><strong>Note on Gwynevere River Song:</strong> Shot by father Robert Wayne Mosher during a family dispute at their home. Grand jury declined to indict (no-billed), reportedly based on self-defense claim. Counted as identified suspect but excluded from solve-rate statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Note on Kenne McFadden:</strong> Mark Daniel Lewis was indicted for manslaughter after admitting he pushed McFadden into the San Antonio River. Prosecutors presented all evidence at a probation revocation hearing; the judge ruled the conduct was not criminal, and due to double jeopardy the case could not proceed to a criminal trial. Counted as "Charges Dismissed."</li>
    <li><strong>Note on TeeTee Dangerfield:</strong> Tyrone Kemp was charged with malice murder but acquitted by a jury in November 2021. Because Kemp was cleared, the case is counted as unsolved — the actual killer has not been identified.</li>
    <li><strong>Note on Ava Le'Ray Barrin:</strong> Jalen Breon Brown was charged with murder and aggravated assault. In May 2018, Judge Eric Norris granted a self-defense immunity motion and dismissed all charges. Counted as "Charges Dismissed."</li>
    <li><strong>Note on Kashmire Nazier Redd:</strong> Doris Carrasquillo was charged with first-degree manslaughter but cleared by a jury that found she acted in self-defense.</li>
  </ul>
