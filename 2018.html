<!-- CHART 1: SUSPECTS by Race -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 1: Identified Suspects by Race/Ethnicity</div><div class="chart-sub">Solved homicide cases with identified suspects. N = 13 suspects.</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartSUSPECTS"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Note:</strong> Of 13 identified suspects, 7 (54%) were Black, 3 (23%) were White, and 3 (23%) were Hispanic. Black suspects were the largest group despite Black Americans comprising ~13% of the U.S. population; however, the victim pool was also disproportionately Black (77%), and most violence was intraracial.</div></div>

<!-- CHART 2: VICTIMS by Race -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 2: Victims by Race/Ethnicity</div><div class="chart-sub">All 26 victims documented in 2018</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartVICTIMS"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Note:</strong> Black transgender women comprised 20 of 26 victims (77%), confirming the extreme disproportionality of lethal violence toward this demographic. Latina victims represented 12% (3) and White victims 12% (3).</div></div>

<!-- CHART 3: Suspect-Victim Race Pairings -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 3: Suspect → Victim Race Pairings (Specific)</div><div class="chart-sub">Each bar = one specific pairing. Green = intraracial, Red = interracial. N = 13 solved cases.</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartPAIRINGS"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Finding:</strong> 11 of 13 solved cases (85%) were intraracial — the suspect and victim shared the same racial category. Two cases were interracial (Black suspect → Latina victim; Hispanic suspect → Black victim). This largely mirrors national homicide patterns where most violence occurs within racial groups.</div></div>

<!-- CHART 4: Solved vs Unsolved by Race -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 4: Solved vs. Unsolved by Victim Race</div><div class="chart-sub">Racial disparity in case resolution. N = 26.</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartSOLVED"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Key disparity:</strong> Only 7 of 20 Black victims' cases were solved (35%), compared to 3 of 3 for White victims (100%) and 3 of 3 for Latina victims (100%). The stark disparity in solve rates by victim race is consistent with systemic under-investigation of homicides affecting Black transgender women.</div></div>

<!-- CHART 5: Bias Motive -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 5: Bias Motive Coding</div><div class="chart-sub">All 26 victims coded by bias motive evidence</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartBIAS"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Methodology:</strong> Confirmed = hate crime charges or explicit LE statement. Suspected = evidence of animus, no charge. No Evidence = documented alternative motive (IPV, robbery, serial killing). Unknown = insufficient info or unsolved with no motive.</div></div>

<!-- CHART 6: Bias by Suspect Race -->
<div class="chart-card"><div class="chart-title">Chart 6: Bias Motive by Suspect Race</div><div class="chart-sub">Solved cases only — suspects with known race. N = 13.</div><div class="chart-wrap"><canvas height="300" id="chartBIAS_RACE"></canvas></div><div class="note-box"><strong>Note:</strong> No cases in 2018 resulted in confirmed hate crime charges. The 2 "Suspected" cases both involved Black suspects in intimate/sexual encounters with Black trans women (Stanton and Stough), where concealment of the relationship or trans identity may have been a factor.</div></div>

<div class="note-box"><strong>Methodology:</strong> Victim list from <a href="https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/AntiTransViolence-2018Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank">HRC's 2018 report</a>. All details independently verified via local news and court records. HRC assessments not used for bias motive, case status, or suspect demographics. All suspect race designations independently verified via mugshots, booking photos, official police descriptions, or court records (February 2026 audit). <strong>Key corrections from 2026 audit:</strong> Amia Tyrae Berryman (#7) was solved within 4 days — Dedrick Butler arrested March 30, 2018 (HRC and LGBTQ advocacy sources never reported the arrest, creating a persistent error in community datasets). Keisha Wells (#15): James Butler charged with complicity (disposing body) but primary shooter remains unidentified — counted as unsolved. Brittany White (#24): Included per HRC listing; Dallas Voice reported the victim also identified as a gay man. Londonn Moore (#20)&dagger;: At trial, prosecutors and the victim's mother confirmed the victim (Tyren Kinard) identified as a gay man, not transgender — included per HRC listing but classification is disputed. Nino Fortson (#10): Identified as a transgender man / gender-nonconforming person. Gigi Pierce (#11): Sophia Adler was initially charged with murder but a grand jury declined to indict; the killing was ruled self-defense. Adler pled guilty only to unlawful firearm possession — not counted as a murder suspect.</div>
