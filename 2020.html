<h1>Fatal Violence Against Transgender &amp; Gender Non-Conforming People — 2020</h1>


<div class="methodology">
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>This analysis uses the <a href="https://reports.hrc.org/an-epidemic-of-violence-fatal-violence-against-transgender-and-gender-non-confirming-people-in-the-united-states-in-2020" target="_blank">Human Rights Campaign's 2020 tracking of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people</a> as a <strong>starting point for victim names only</strong>. All case details — suspect identification, arrest records, court outcomes, bias motive determinations, and demographic data — were independently verified through local news reporting, court records, and law enforcement press releases via a minimum two-search protocol per case ("[victim] killed" + "[victim] arrested/charged"). HRC is never cited as a source for case data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Race verification</strong>: From mugshots and explicit police/media descriptions, not surnames.</li>
<li><strong>Bias motive coding</strong>: Confirmed = hate crime charges OR explicit anti-trans motive from LE; Suspected = evidence of animus without formal charges; No Evidence = IPV, robbery, random; Unknown = insufficient info.</li>
<li><strong>Police-involved cases</strong>: Excluded from solve rates and suspect demographic charts. Both police-involved cases in 2020 were reviewed by oversight bodies and found to be justified use of force — meaning the officers responded to an imminent threat to their lives. These are not classified as murders under any legal framework. Notably, HRC's own earlier reports (e.g., the 2015 report) excluded justified police killings from their tallies. Their subsequent decision to include them without distinction inflates the headline count and conflates lawful use of force with criminal homicide, raising methodological concerns about the consistency and reliability of HRC's year-over-year figures.</li>
<li><strong>Chart 6 (Bias by Suspect Race)</strong>: Excludes unknown-race suspects and police-involved cases.</li>
<li><strong>Notable finding</strong>: There were <strong>no known White suspects</strong> among all 37 cases in 2020. Every identified suspect was Black or Hispanic.</li>
</ul>
