  <div class="note-box"><strong>Note:</strong> 20 of 22 victims (91%) were Black transgender women. The remaining 2 victims were White (1 trans woman, 1 trans man killed in Dayton mass shooting). This stark racial disparity mirrors national patterns of violence disproportionately targeting Black trans women.</div>

Suspected = evidence of animus, no charge (Chanel Scurlock — dating app lure to isolated location). No Evidence = documented alternative motive (Tracy Single — IPV; Jordan Cofer — mass shooting).

However, no formal charges or suspect name were ever publicly released, and no trial or conviction information exists as of Feb. 2026.

<div class="note-box"><strong>Victim List — Reconciliation with HRC Report:</strong> HRC's original PDF report (<em>A National Epidemic: Fatal Anti-Transgender Violence in the United States in 2019</em>, published Nov. 18, 2019) named 22 victims. That list was read into the Congressional Record on Nov. 20, 2019 during Transgender Day of Remembrance remarks. Two individuals from the original 22 were subsequently removed from tracking by advocates after further investigation: <strong>Jazzaline Ware</strong> (Memphis, TN) — Memphis police concluded she died of natural causes, not homicide; and <strong>Jamagio Jamar Berryman</strong> (Kansas City, KS) — the Berryman family released a video clarifying the victim was not transgender. This leaves 20 confirmed homicide victims from the original report. This dataset adds two additional victims documented after the report's Nov. 18 publication date: <strong>Nikki Kuhnhausen</strong> (missing Jun. 6, remains found Dec. 7) and <strong>Yahira Nesby</strong> (killed Dec. 19), both of which HRC later added to its web tracker (which eventually counted "at least 27" by year's end). HRC's later web updates also included individuals not in this dataset: Ellie Marie Washtock (described as "gender-expansive," death circumstances unclear), Titi Gulley (death originally ruled suicide; investigation reopened but outcome unclear), Johana Medina Leon (died in ICE custody), and Layleen Cubilette-Polanco (died at Rikers Island). These were excluded because this dataset is limited to confirmed homicides outside of custodial settings. Victims are listed in chronological order by date of death, which closely mirrors the HRC report's ordering.</div>

<div class="note-box"><strong>Case Research Methodology:</strong> All case details independently verified via local news, court records, and law enforcement press releases — not HRC assessments. Each case searched at minimum twice: initial incident report + arrest/charge update through Feb. 2026. Suspect race verified from mugshots or explicit police descriptions (e.g., HPD notation "b/m" for Raymond Donald Williams; DOJ photos for Daqua Ritter; Dallas PD official statement identifying Lyles as "a Black male"; Michigan DOC racial ID for Robinson), never from surnames. Police-involved killings excluded from solve rates and suspect demographics. Bee Love Slater coded "Unsolved" because only an accessory-after-the-fact was arrested (Dec. 2021); the actual shooter remains unidentified. Jordan Cofer's case coded "Closed" (mass shooting; perpetrator deceased at scene). Dominick Archield released Nov. 2024 after ~4 years in jail without trial; charges still formally pending but case dismissal possible. Brianna "BB" Hill's case updated: a suspect was detained at the scene (per KCPD Capt. Hernandez) but no formal charges or name were ever publicly released. Pebbles LaDime Doe's case updated to reflect Daqua Ritter's Feb. 2024 federal hate crime conviction and Oct. 2024 life sentence — the first such conviction based on gender identity under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The Nikki Kuhnhausen case prompted the Nikki Kuhnhausen Act (HB 1687), banning the "LGBTQ+ panic defense" in Washington state (signed Mar. 2020). The HRC report is available via <a href="https://issuu.com/humanrightscampaign/docs/anti-transviolencereport2019" target="_blank">Issuu</a>; HRC no longer hosts the original PDF.</div>
